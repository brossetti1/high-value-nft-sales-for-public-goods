* Story: This was the birth of the Pleaser DAO - the NFT was released by Uniswap in collaboration with the artist. Big names in the DEFI space started to bid against each other for this NFT.. pretty soon [Leighton Cusack](Video-The-Formation-of-PleasrDAO-Leighton-Cusack), founder of [Pool Together](https://pooltogether.com/) ran out of available eth to bid higher, but he still wanted to be apart of the NFT. So he suggested on twitter that those who cant bid hihger form together in a DAO to buy the NFT. A group was formed and ultimately people stopped bidding against each other and formed together to do the final bid. It was quite moving for the [artist](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO/status/1398416178201067523).
